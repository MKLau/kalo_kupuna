Kalo Major Variety Group Morphological Characteristics
======================================================

Building on the work determining a set of SNPs for genetic assessment,
this analysis seeks to detect the important morphological traits that
align with genetic similarity.

# Data

- Genetic data in "doi_10.5061_dryad.r35kr__v1" are SNPs from
  Helmkampf et al. 2018.

# Docs

- Several useful papers in here, including Helmkampf et al. 2018.
