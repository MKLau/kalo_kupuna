# Kalo Groups - Major Characteristics

## GROUP KAI 

- Concave, pendant blades 
- Finely undulating margins
- Generally wetland
- Alkaline tolerant
- Stagnant water tolerant
- Tolerant of deep or soft patches
- Possibly resistant to soft rot
- Cooking is often twice as long as for other varieties
- Rubbery texture of the cooked corms
- Fragrant odor (ala) is usually emitted when the corms are cooked
- High pa‘ai yield


## GROUP MANA

- Branching (generally rare except in mature corms)
- Generally upright petioles
- Petioles curved at apex
- Leaf hangs nearly vertically
- Narrow blades
- Piko splotching, extending to midrib and veins
- Generally early maturing (7-9 mo)
- Corms yellow
- Corms are dry, mealy, flaky

## GROUP ULAULA

- Red or purplish petioles
- Comparatively small, ovate blades
- Reddish-tinged flowers
- High ‘oha proudction 
- Wetland or upland

## GROUP LAULOA

- Long petioles
- Long leaves
- Sagittate leaves
- Undulating margins
- High consistancy of leaf and petiole size among varieties
- Erect, compact habit
- Sparing ‘oha production
- Average matruation (8-12 mo)
- Generally upland
- Generally nonacrid
- Used for medicinal purposes (pulmonary)
- Somatic mutations common


## GROUP MANINI

- Green and reddish-purple or purplish-black striped petioles
- Quite narrow, sagittate leaf blades
- White corm flesh
- Wetland and upland
- Possible disease susceptibility
- Generally low yield


## GROUP PIKO

- Group likely not monophyletic
- Piko trait likely evolved multiple times
- Deep sinus connecting to the piko
- Persistent ridge on the inner surface of the petiole above sinus
- Erect petioles
- Generally horizontal leaf blades
- Generally ovate leaves
- Usually wetland, cooler
- Relatively more ‘oha per plant
- Late maturing (12-15 mo)
- Good poi

## GROUP LEHUA

- Light green petioles
- Spreading petioles
- Smooth, sagittate leaf blades
- Upland and wetland
- Lilac-purple corms
- Red poi 
- Average matruation (8-12 mo)
- Kalo ali‘i 

## GROUP ELEELE

- Blackish or reddish-brown petiole 
- Dark reddish-purple basal ring 
- Dark lilac-purple area for 3 to 4 cm above the ring
- Light lilac-purple corm flesh
- Fast maturing, high production (~8 mo)
- Rot quickly
- Fast huli degeneration
- Generally upland 
- Red poi
