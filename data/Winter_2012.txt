An assessment of
nomenclatural synonymy
and biodiversity

Abstract
The prominence of kalo (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott.)
in Hawaiian culture has declined after experiencing a decrease in cultivation, biodiversity and associated cultural
knowledge. There was no documentation of diversity at its
height. Previous estimates of biodiversity lack any sense
of a methodlogical approach. A new attempt was made
to assess levels of biodiversity around the peak cultivation period. Results were then compared to current levels.
Nomenclatural synonymy and extinction have presented
some challenges which made standard methods for quantifying biodiversity not viable. A set of new tools was used
to sort through a master list of 676 varietal names. A comparison of what is known from the nineteenth century and
modern time periods makes it apparent that changes in
biodiversity, varietal prominence, ethnonomenclature, and
ethnotaxonomy have occurred. This paper discusses the
direction of such trends, and postulates a new estimate
for kalo diversity at the end of the 19th century (approximately 100 years after the assumed peak of cultivation
and diversity) to be between 368-482 distinct cultivars,
while only 65-73 still exist today.

from that perspective, at least on a symbolic level. On a
practical level its prominence is rivaled only by ʻuala or
sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) (Handy 1940,
Handy et al. 1972, Ladefoged et al. 2009). This is true especially in the era prior to contact with foreigners in 1778
(Handy 1940, Handy et al. 1972, Kamakau 1972, 1976,
Kameʻeleihiwa 1990, MacCaughey & Emerson 1913,
Malo 2006). Contemporarily, kalo continues to be held in
the utmost level of respect among many staunch cultural
practitioners, although its general prominence in the Hawaiian culture as a whole is no doubt less than has been
in previous generations. This is due, in large part, to various reasons such as changes in land tenure and socioeconomic systems which, in many cases, resulted in a
loss of cultural identity (Kameʻeleihiwa 1992, Trask 1999).
Because of the glaring losses of both biodiversity and associated cultural knowledge it is important to gain a more
refined understanding of kalo diversity at its height for
several reasons, not the least of which includes quantifying its importance to the Hawaiian culture and gaining insight into the horticultural skills of the ancient Hawaiians.

Introduction
Taro, Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott, has been historically one of the most important crop plants in the tropical
Pacific with distribution reaching as far east as the islands
of Polynesia. The global trends in loss of both biodiversity and associated cultural knowledge have not escaped
this species throughout its range. The most remote island group of Polynesia is Hawaiʻi, where taro is known
as kalo.

Ethnobotany Research & Applications

The intensity of kalo cultivation has changed over time.
Kalo was originally brought to Hawaiʻi in Polynesian voyaging canoes (Abbott 1995) at least 1,000 years ago (Burney & Kikuchi 2006), and the intensity of its cultivation
undoubtedly increased as the Hawaiian population did. It
is assumed that this period of intensified cultivation was
accompanied by a corresponding increase in intraspecies diversity (i.e., cultivar diversity) via somatic mutations
(Handy et al. 1972) and possibly even cross-breeding
(Handy et al. 1972, Irwin et al. 1998). Cultivation is assumed to have reached its peak at the height of population density around the time of contact with foreign cultures in 1778. At that time the Hawaiian population was
estimated to be approximately 1 million people. This period was followed by a 90% population collapse due to introduced diseases (Stannard 1989). The intensity of kalo
cultivation decreased dramatically during this same period (Anonymous 1879, Cho et al. 2007, Handy et al. 1972,
Ladefoged et al. 2009, Müller et al. 2010). During this post
peak-cultivation period, several authors attempted to record kalo diversity (Handy 1940, Henriques n.d., Iokepa
& Kekahuna n.d., Kalanianaʻole n.d., MacCaughey & Emerson 1913, 1914, Rooke n.d., Whitney et al. 1939, Wight
n.d., Wilder 1934), likely in reaction to the extinction crisis
that they were witnessing. All of these authors were documenting biodiversity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries during the period of rapid diversity loss (see below),
so in analyzing the works of these authors we could, at
best, only gauge post peak-diversity levels.
The terms “cultivar” and “variety” are used throughout this
paper. The word “cultivar” is used to describe an anthropomorphically recognized taxa that is genetically distinct
from other taxa. The word “variety” is used to describe the
name of a particular cultivar. It is important to note that a
single cultivar can have several varietal names that are
associated with it. These are considered to be synonyms.
A good measure of a crop’s importance to any particular culture is the number of cultivars which are managed
by that culture (Rhindos 1984). Kalo is no exception to
this rule as the number of recorded varieties far surpasses that of any of the other crop-plants cultivated by the
ancient Hawaiians (e.g., sweet potato (I. batatas), bananas (Musa acuminata X balbisiana Colla.), breadfruit
(Artocarpus altilis (Parkinson) Fosberg), yams (Dioscorea
spp.), and arrowroot (Tacca leontopetaloides (L.) Kuntze)
(Handy 1940)). A major challenge in assessing biodiversity is the fact that there has been a substantial time-gap
between the height of kalo cultivation in Hawaiʻi — when
the highest levels of biodiversity are assumed to have existed — and the current era. This has been due, in large
part, to a dramatic decrease in both area of kalo cultivation and the number of kalo farmers. In the course of this
time gap most of the varieties have apparently gone extinct. Further complicating the situation is the concurrent
decrease in associated cultural knowledge that has accompanied the decline in cultivation. This is perhaps best

illustrated in the shift away from Hawaiian as the only language towards English as the only language that accompanied this period (Schütz 1994), and which undoubtedly
had a negative influence on the general understanding of
the ethnonomenclature and ethnoclassification systems
of the Hawaiian language. This knowledge vacuum regarding the traditional names and relationships of the various kalo cultivars was eventually filled by horticulturalistbased views on the matter. Since neither the knowledge
of traditional taxonomy, nor the high biodiversity-levels of
kalo exists today, there is no standardized way to assess
the former levels of biodiversity. Furthermore, there does
not seem to be more than a few farmers alive today in
all of Hawaiʻi who represent an unbroken link in the once
widespread tradition of maintaining multiple (more than a
dozen) cultivars on a family farm.
A major reason for this paucity of traditional farmers is
the fact that, for several decades during the last half of
the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, much
of kalo farming was done by Chinese and Japanese immigrants rather than Hawaiians (Cho et al. 2007, MacCaughey & Emerson 1913). Even today much of the kalo
which is currently under cultivation is farmed by the descendants of Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino immigrant
laborers; as well as first generation immigrants from the
Philippines and Micronesia. In many cases contemporary Hawaiian kalo farmers, at some point in the last 150
years, have had at least a single generational break in
tradition between themselves and the Hawaiian farmers
of old. Because of this, and the now-prolific horticulturistbased views on kalo diversity, the general understanding
of kalo diversity (i.e., nomenclature and taxonomy) held
by contemporary farmers has likely changed in the past
150 years.
In spite of previous attempts to document kalo diversity
there is still a lack of certainty about the true levels at,
or near, the height of cultivation in Hawaiʻi. This lack of
certainty stems from the information sources either lacking a strong understanding of traditional Hawaiian nomenclature and taxonomy, scientific rigor in their diversity assessments, or both. In order to more accurately assess
the true diversity of kalo at or near the height of cultivation
in Hawaiʻi, this study attempts to marry a firm understanding of traditional Hawaiian nomenclature and taxonomy,
with a more rigorous assessment of the entire collection
of names and descriptions amassed from several different sources.
A major contributing factor for our lack of understanding
about previous levels of diversity, aside from the extinction crisis which started in the 19th century as described
above, is the complexity of synonymy that exists in the
body of recorded varietal names. Synonymy is the application of more than one name to a single taxon. Synonymy is known to exist in the Hawaiian language, and has
been well documented broadly—in both the lexicon (Pu-

kui & Elbert 1979, 1986) and taxonomic systems (Abbott
1995), and for kalo specifically (Chun 1994, 1998, Handy
1940, Iokepa & Kekahuna n.d., MacCaughey & Emerson
n.d., 1913, Pukui & Elbert 1986, Wilder 1934, field notes).
In a review of the above sources it is apparent that there
are two general classes of synonymy in the Hawaiian lexicon — linguistically-based synonymy and classificationbased synonymy. Linguistically-based synonymy occurs
when different regions which follow the same classification system have differing pronunciations of the same taxon. Such differences correspond to either vowel or consonant deletions, additions or substitutions. As an example, the variety name, Mākohi, was also called Mākohe,
Mōkohi, Mōkohe and Mākihi (Handy 1940, MacCaughey
& Emerson n.d., 1913, Pukui & Elbert 1986) in other areas
that followed the same classification system. On the other hand, classification-based synonyms occur when one
taxon is found in multiple areas, some of which follow differing classification systems. The same taxon, Mākohi,
was known as ʻEleʻele mākoko (Iokepa & Kekahuna n.d.)
in another classification system, and also as Makaʻōpio
(Chun 1994) in yet another. This recognition has influenced the methodological approach, data analysis and
conclusions of this paper.
This publication is not meant to be the “end all, be all”
definitive authority on kalo diversity. It is merely an attempt to add data and analysis to the contemporary body
of knowledge, and to reawaken the discussion of kalo diversity. Recent research has acknowledged the formerly
high levels of kalo diversity and its subsequent decline
(Cho et al. 2007), but new data and analysis have not
been contributed to the debate since Whitney et al. (1939)
and Handy (1940).
Although it is not dealt with substantively in this manuscript, it is important to note that many varieties had (and
some continue to have) unique and specific traditions associated with them. Examples of these are the now-extinct Hoene, which was used medicinally for enemas; and
currently-rare ʻApuwai, whose cup-shaped leaves catch
rainwater that is used in ceremonies. Once varieties go
extinct, so too die the cultural practices which required
those specific taxa for implementation (Winter & McClatchey 2009). Further research may be able to quantify
the cultural loss that has accompanied a loss of cultivars.

Methods
This study has three specific assumptions that are based
in the idea that there are direct relationships both between
biodiversity and linguistic diversity (Nettle & Romaine
2000), and also between biodiversity and cultural diversity (Winter and McClatchey 2008 & 2009). They are as
follows:
1. Kalo biodiversity and associated cultural knowledge
is linked, and this relationship has generally expe-

425

rienced both a coupled increase and a coupled decrease in the past 1,000 years,
2. The height of kalo diversity and associated cultural
knowledge existed at the height of kalo cultivation in
Hawaiʻi, and
3. The height of kalo cultivation existed at the point of
contact with foreign cultures in 1778.
Since this study attempts to assess a level of intraspecies diversity that no longer exists, readily accepted methodologies for assessing diversity (i.e., field surveys and
free-listing exercises to reveal relative abundance/varietal
richness resulting in an index of diversity,) are not viable
methods. In order to measure change over time, kalo diversity has been measured at two points in time: 1) The
era ranging from the late 19th to early 20th centuries (citations ranging from 1879-1940) which represents a period
of diversity decline after the presumed height of kalo cultivation, via an assessment of nomenclatural diversity; and
2) Contemporarily, via biodiversity assessments. Comparisons between these estimates were then made.
Surveys of Nomenclatural Diversity
Nomenclatural diversity assessments were done beginning with a review of published and archival resources in
Hawaiian and English. Published and archival materials
were qualitatively analyzed in two areas: adherence to
trends in Hawaiian nomenclature and taxonomic systems,
and adherence to the scientific method. Trends in ethnonomenclature and ethnotaxonomy were identified by
Berlin (1992) and have been demonstrated to be applicable to Proto Oceanic ethnonomenclature and ethnoclassification systems (Evans 2008) which are the evolutionary precursor to Hawaiian nomenclature and classification systems. In Hawaiian systems, Berlin’s (1992) trends
have been substantiated by the descriptions of both Hawaiian plant experts (i.e., kahuna lāʻau lapaʻau or highly
skilled herbal healers) (Chun 1994, 1998, Gon 2008) and
botanists studying Hawaiian nomenclature systems (St.
John 1982). These trends are later used in assessing the
quality of citations (see below section, Rigor Assessments
for Cited Authorities).
The trends seen documented in sources regarding synonymy in the Hawaiian lexicon (Abbott 1995, Chun
1994, 1998, Handy 1940, Iokepa & Kekahuna n.d., MacCaughey & Emerson n.d.,1913, Pukui & Elbert 1986,
Wilder 1934, field notes) were used in assessing synonymy within the nomenclature of kalo. An attempt was made
to sort through the collection of kalo names and descriptions to come to both a liberal and a conservative estimate of the number of distinct cultivars in the post-contact
cultivation period, as this is the era when the documentation occurred. The first twenty-three rules (see below),
which primarily deal with linguistically-based synonymy in
nature, are applied to find the highest end of the estimated
range (i.e., a liberal estimate of kalo diversity). Rule 23 is
derived from the presence of documented varietal names

www.ethnobotanyjournal.org/vol10/i1547-3465-10-423.pdf

corresponding to proper names of kalo-based characters in stories such as the names seen in “The Story of
Big Taro and Little Taro” (Anonymous1861, Nohokuaaina
1867). An additional twelve rules, which relate to adherence to trends in ethnonomenclature and ethnoclassification, are applied to find the lowest end of the estimated
range (i.e., a conservative estimate of kalo diversity.
Synonymy or other erroneous nomenclature was identified by the presence of the below described conditions.
All of the conditions are founded in already documented
synonymy (Abbott 1995, Chun 1994, Handy 1940, Iokepa
& Kekahuna n.d., MacCaughey & Emerson 1913, 1914,
Pukui & Elbert 1979, 1986, Whitney et al. 1939, Wilder
1934), and then applied broadly. If any of these conditions
were met the names were either consolidated in or eliminated from the master list. It is important to note that although these synonyms may initially appear questionable,
due to their possible meaning-altering appearance, several of these are previously documented synonyms (i.e.,
Kūʻoho and Kūʻohu), and therefore may represent examples of linguistic engineering for ease of pronunciation.
Vowel substitutions and additions:
1. o/u substitutions (example: Kūʻoho / Kūʻohu)
2. a/o substitutions (example: Hāakea / Hāokea)
3. a/e substitutions (example: ʻIeʻie / ʻIaʻia)
4. e/i substitutions (example: Wehiwa / Wehewa)
5. “a” additions on the end of a word (example: Papakole / Papakolea)
6. “o” additions at the end of a word (example: Māna /
Māna-o-)
Consonant substitutions and deletions:
7. n/l substitutions (example: Māna ʻowene / Māna
ʻuwele)
8. ʻ/m/n substitutions (example: Manauea / Mamauea /
Maʻauea)
9. “w” deletions (example: Pualu / Puwalu)
Various classes of reduplication:
10. Reduplication of first vowel (example: ʻApu / ʻAʻapu)
11. Reduplication of last vowel (example: Māiʻi / Māiʻiʻi)
12. Full reduplication of both species names (example:
Pia / Piapia), and subspecies epithets (example: ʻula
/ ʻulaʻula).
13. Partial
reduplications
(example:
Hāpuʻu/
Hāpuʻupuʻu)
14. Prefix reduplications (example: Wehiwa / Wewehiwa
Backformation:
15. Contractions (example: ʻEleʻele / ʻEʻele)
Miscellaneous:
16. Prefix additions of hā on subspecies epithets (example: hāʻulaʻula / ʻulaʻula)
17. Similar color descriptors unless indicated as separate
cultivars (example: kea / keʻokeʻo, melemele / lenalena, ʻulaʻula / lehua)

18. Maoli as type specimen in group, and a kalo species
with no subspecies epithet associated with it (example: Hāpuʻupuʻu maoli / Hāpuʻupuʻu)
19. Documented synonymy for group names where
subspecies epithets are the same (example: Piko
ʻeleʻele / Haehae ʻeleʻele / Uaua ʻeleʻele).
20. Obvious mis-spellings or transcription errors (example: Haehae keʻokoʻa / H. keʻokeʻo)
21. Similar meanings in subspecies epithets using synonymous words/terms (example: Lehua kū-i-ka-wao
/ Lehua kū-kuahiwi)
22. Names documented as being assigned to post-contact introductions (example: Pākē, ʻIliuaua)
23. Seemingly proper names (example: Kalo nui e /
Kalo iki e)
Further consolidations for a conservative estimate, founded in adherence to trends in ethnonomenclature and ethnoclassification, were done if the following conditions occurred:
24. The name is poetic (example: Kaʻawelu-i-ka-pali-oAwakea).
25. The name is a trinomial.
26. The name is seemingly vulgar (examples: He-ʻowāhulu-nui, Heu-ā-lehu, Heu-ʻele, Pani-kohe).
27. Group names exist that are noted as synonyms for
other crops (example: Manini / Koaʻe, Mākea / Mahakea)
28. ʻUlaʻula as a group name is a synonym for the Kūmū
group
29. ʻEleʻele and Nohu as group-names are synonyms
for the Naioea group
30. ʻAla as a group name is a synonym for the Kāī group.
31. A lack of documentation of the word “maoli” (meaning “type-specimen”) in the subspecies epithet (example: for the ʻApuwai group three names are collectively recorded - ʻApuwai, ʻA. keʻokeʻo and ʻA.
ʻulaʻula. These will be counted as two cultivars instead of three. For the Hāpuʻu group six names are
collectively documented - Hāpuʻu maoli, H. ʻeleʻele,
H. kea, H. lenalena, H. nūkea, and H. ʻulaʻula.
These were counted as six cultivars).
32. The name is a monomial which is also the name of an
ahupuaʻa (traditional land-division unit). Such names
may have been given to honor the cultivar’s place of
origin when cultivars were transferred in the absence
of knowledge about their original name.
33. Species-level names listed as monomials are subspecies epithets noted elsewhere in a binomial (Lauloa papamū / Papamū).
34. Species-subspecies nomenclatural reciprocations
(ʻUlaʻula poni, Poni ʻulaʻula).
35. The various monomials which vaguely indicate either
a black-colored or striped petiole are considered synonyms for other varieties accounted for elsewhere in
the list (Pōpolo, Hiwa; Kāniʻo, Niʻo).
Data on the occurrence of documented synonymy for
each respective source were also recorded. The percent-

age of synonymy was calculated for each source using
the following equation:
ns / nt = synonymy percentage,
where, ns is the number of varietal names documented as
having a synonym, and nt is the total number of varietal
names documented.
Biodiversity Assessment
Kalo collections of botanical gardens, agriculture stations,
and private individuals/families (including both commercial and subsistence farms) were surveyed on the islands
of Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Maui, and Hawaiʻi between the
years of 2003-2012. Accession information for living specimens was reviewed (if available), and the specimens’
morphological traits were compared against the descriptions of Whitney et al. (1939) to confirm accuracy. Through
the generosity of these entities and individuals, collections
were made for propagation on the island of Kauaʻi where
a common garden experiment was conducted under a
nursery setting between 2011-2012. The plants in the experiment were verified using Whitney et al. (1939), and
also by recognized community experts on kalo diversity
(Jerry Konanui & Penny Levin). Voucher specimens have
been prepared of these varieties that have been deposited in the National Tropical Botanical Garden herbarium
(PTBG), Kalaheo, Kauaʻi, Hawaiʻi.
Rigor Assessments for Cited Authorities
Qualitative cultural and scientific rigor assessments were
conducted. Cultural rigor was weighed against adherence
to trends in Hawaiian nomenclature systems. Scientific
rigor was weighed against whether or not data collection
was qualitative or quantitative, and if comparative analysis was done.
Cultural rigor was assessed and given designations by
the following criteria:
•
High – Authors have produced other manuscripts and
publications regarding ethnonomenclature and ethnoclassification.
•
Medium – Authors did not produce other manuscripts
and publications regarding ethnonomenclature and
ethnoclassification, but data produced follows the
trends articulated by Berlin (1992).
•
Low – Authors did not produce other manuscripts and
publications regarding ethnonomenclature and ethnoclassification, and data produced is in conflict with
the trends articulated by Berlin (1992).
Scientific rigor was assessed and given designations by
the following criteria:
•
High – Collected quantitative data regarding morphology in a common garden experiment, and did
comparative analysis of this data.

•
•
•

427

Medium – Collected qualitative data regarding morphology in a common garden experiment, and did
comparative analysis of this data.
Low – Collected qualitative data regarding morphology from different locations and environments for comparative analysis.
Non-existent – No evidence of either data collection
regarding morphology or comparative analysis.

Status assessments for once-prevalent cultivars
Status assessments for once-prevalent cultivars were
done based on the above described field observations.
Field status was assessed and given designations by the
following criteria:
•
Common – Cultivar was documented in commercial
farms, family farms/gardens, and botanical collections.
•
Occasional – Cultivar was not documented in commercial farms, but was documented in family farms/
gardens, and botanical collections.
•
Rare – Cultivar was neither documented in commercial farms nor family farms/gardens, but was documented in botanical collections.
•
Extinct – Cultivar was not documented in commercial
farms or family farms/gardens, and there is no evidence of it existing in botanical collections.

Results
Previous Estimates of Synonymy
Fourteen documents (including published and unpublished archival-manuscripts) relating to names and descriptions of kalo diversity were assessed. These were
written in Hawaiian and English. The document dates
ranged from 1879-1986. The most recent of these (Pukui and Elbert 1986) was a compilation of previous works,
not a representation of field work. Future mention of these
document dates will refer to 1879-1940 which represents
the range of time that field data was collected. Five of the
manuscripts have no date associated with them, but judging from their presence in the Bishop Museum Archives
they are likely from the same period. From the lists within
these, a total of 669 varietal names of kalo were accumulated. Seven more were added from oral history documents representing a total of 676 names. Typographical errors and non-Hawaiian varieties (i.e., Asian and
South Pacific cultivars that were given adoptive Hawaiian-names) were removed reducing the list to 598 varietal names (Appendix 1). Linguisitically-based synonyms
were then consolidated to 512 varietal names (Appendix
1) that were used for further analysis including a calculation of synonymy. The manuscripts documented synonymy with a range from 0 - 80% (Table 1).

Field Surveys
Field surveys of botanical gardens, agricultural stations, and individual
collections (both commercial and subsistence farms) throughout Hawaiʻi

have determined that there has indeed
been a decline in kalo diversity, even in
the recent historical period. At least 63 of
the heritage kalo cultivars documented in
Whitney et al. (1939) remain. In addition to
these, nine more have been added to the
list of confirmed Hawaiian varieties. These
include two Hawaiian cultivars were added
via hybridization in the 20th century (Maui
Lehua which is a cross between Lehua
maoli and Piʻialiʻi, and Pili-aloha which is
a cross between Kāī kea and Moi), one,
Moi ʻula, which was documented by other
sources (Handy 1940, Iokepa & Kekahuna
n.d., Pukui & Elbert 1986, Wilder 1934),
and one previously undocumented cultivar, Piʻikea. The remaining five (ʻElepaio
hāuliuli, Kāī KBS, Lauloa koukouʻai,
Makalau, and Niumalu) do not match with
documented descriptions, but are debatably Hawaiian. A possible rediscovery of
Lauloa ʻōniʻoniʻo via somatic mutation
(not yet confirmed) brings the total number of remaining Hawaiian cultivars to 73
(Table 2). Outside of the Hawaiian cultivars, at least 71 cultivars have been introduced from around the Pacific and Asia.
In addition to these, literally several thousand cultivars have been created since the
1980s via both officially sanctioned and unofficially sanctioned hybridization experi-

ments (including hybrid crosses) conducted by University
of Hawaiʻi researchers and affiliates using Hawaiian and
non-Hawaiian cultivars. Countless numbers of these have
been distributed to farmers, but there has not been rigorous documentation about their morphology and distribution. Due to the nature of this complexity, an analysis of
these hybrids was excluded from this study.
Field surveys to assess collections of botanical gardens
and University of Hawaiʻi agriculture stations took place
on the islands of Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Maui and Hawaiʻi
which represented broad ranges in environmental conditions. These surveys occurred between 2003 and 2012.
Accession information has revealed that the vast majority
of these collections trace back to the original collections
used to produce the Whitney et al. (1939) publication.
Rigor of Previous Diversity Assessments
All of the sources documenting kalo diversity were qualified as to the rigor of their cultural knowledge as indicated
by their adherence to trends in Hawaiian nomenclature
systems, and scientific rigor as indicated by scientifically-

based data collection and analysis (Table 3). No source
ranked high in both categories.
Taxonomic Trends
Traditional Hawaiian nomenclature and taxonomy as
gleaned from the works produced in collaboration with
recognized Hawaiian plant experts (i.e., those designated
as having “high” cultural rigor in Table 3) conformed to the
trends in ethnobiological classification as articulated by
Berlin (1992). This is illustrated by Table 4 as an isolated
example, and in Figure 1 as a contextual example.
Trends in Nomenclature
One of the trends seen in the data is that many of the species-level names fall into one of the following categories.
•
Fish names (at least 26 species-level names)
•
ʻAkilolo – yellow-tail wrasse (Coris gaimard
Quoy & Gaimard, 1824)
•
Kūmū – whitesaddle goatfish (Parupeneus porphyreus Jenkins, 1903)
•
Manini – convict tang (Acanthurus triostegus L.,
1758)

Discussion
Hawaiian Taxonomic Systems and Synonymy
In the context of traditional Hawaiian nomenclature systems, synonymy—especially among the islands—was prevalent for useful plants both wild and
cultivated (Abbott 1995, Chun 1994, Pukui & Elbert
1986). Before the time of Kamehameha’s consoli-

dation of the five kingdoms into one (i.e., the Kingdom
of Hawaiʻi, around the turn of the 19th century) under his
rule, each kingdom had their own systems to understand
their world — including calendars and taxonomic systems
(Handy et al. 1972). Despite differing levels of endemism
(for both wild and cultivated plants) on each island, each
island seemed to be dealing with the same core set of
useful wild and cultivated plants. However, since each
kingdom had its own system for understanding and working with the natural world, many plants had not only different names, but also different relationships (i.e., classifications) within taxonomic systems on the different islands
(i.e., former kingdoms). The data collected and analyzed
in this paper originated in different classification systems,
documentation of which is spotty at best. This has added
to the complexity of data analysis.
The Complexity of Synonymy and
Previous Estimates of Kalo Diversity
Like the taxonomic system for native plants, some kalo
varieties have different names on different islands. They
also may be positioned differently within each island’s respective taxonomic system (Handy 1940, Handy et al.
1972, MacCaughey & Emerson 1913).
The amount of synonymy within the collection of varietal
names can cause much confusion. Collectors sometimes
noted synonymy, but undoubtedly were not able to document every case. Furthermore, several contradictions
exist in records of synonymy and descriptions. As an example the variety, Piʻialiʻi, is listed by Wilder (1934) as
having the following synonyms: ʻAhapiʻi, Moi ʻula, and
Mākohe. Of these, Mākohe is listed as a synonym for
Mākohi by MacCaughey and Emerson (1913, 1914).
Mākohi is listed as a synonym for ʻEleʻele mākoko by Iokepa and Kekahuna (n.d.), but Whitney et al. (1939) have
treated ʻEleʻele mākoko and Piʻialiʻi as completely different and unrelated cultivars. Furthermore, Mākohi is listed
as a synonym for Makaʻōpio by Chun (1994), but Whitney et al. (1939) treats Makaʻōpio as a synonym for Piko
ʻeleʻele, Haehae ʻeleʻele, Hele-mauna, and Ipu-o-lono
— each of which is listed as further synonyms for yet other
varieties by the other authors, and the complexity continues on. Because of the contradictions that exist between
the authors, the synonymy that they document was left
out of the analysis of data accumulated here (Appendix
1), and linguistics and ethnoclassification became the primary tools for analysis.
Previous authors expressed different thoughts and conclusions on the matter of synonymy. Handy (1940) did not
think that kalo had the same high level of synonymy as
ʻuala (sweet potato):
“…I am inclined to think that there is far less duplication of names than might be expected… The taros
are more uniform in coloring than the sweet potatoes.
Their cultivation was an all-year science, while sweet

potato planting was spasmodic. The taro farmer was
a systematic gardener, the sweet potato planter a casual farmer. Furthermore, taros are less easily transported for replanting than sweet potatoes. Hence
there was great exactitude in nomenclature and less
renaming—when the original name was unknown or
forgotten—by the giving of a new descriptive name or
the name of the person who brought in a new variety
or created one from bud mutations.” (Handy 1940)
Handy (1940) did not, however, state an estimated level of
synonymy. Both MacCaughey and Emerson (1913), and
Whitney et al. (1939) agreed that about 50% of collected
varietal names could be considered synonyms (this will
be referred to as the “50% Rule” from hereafter). However, this 50% Rule that they put forward seems to have
no foundation as the estimate since it is not reflected in an
analysis of their own data (see Table 1), and they provided
no other reasons for the estimate. In fact, an analysis of
the data collected by the various authors reveals that they
documented synonymy ranging from eight (8) to 80% (see
Table 1). This range is too broad to pin down even an approximation of actual synonymy that existed at or near the
height of cultivation, and therefore further analysis was
needed.
Previous works relating to the subject were assessed in
an attempt to sort through the inconsistent nomenclature, synonymy, and taxonomic treatments. One problem is that several of the early authors (Anonymous 1879,
Henriques n.d., Iokepa & Kekahuna n.d., Kalanianaʻole
n.d., MacCaughey & Emerson 1913, 1914, Rooke n.d.)
did not use a standardized method for collection or description. These sources range from only a collection of
names with no descriptions, to a list of either vague or at
best non-scientifically substantiated descriptions. It wasn’t
until Wilder (1934) and Handy (1940) that attempts were
made to approach documenting diversity in a scientific
manner. However, the data that they produced was qualitative and the rigor of their approach is questionable. Finally, Whitney et al. (1939) attempted to compile a comprehensive collection of names and scientifically quantified descriptions which were based on a common garden
experiment. However, Whitney et al. (1939) state, regarding their study, that many of the Hawaiian kalo cultivars
had already gone extinct or were so rare that they were
not located. Whitney et al. (1939) tried to sort through
synonymy via their common garden studies. Their conclusions lumped together several varieties that previous
authors noted as being clearly distinct by using characteristics that do not change based on environmental conditions (e.g., petiole-base color). Specifically, Whitney et
al.’s (1939) taxonomic treatment was in contradiction to
those of Handy (1940), Wilder (1934) and Anonymous
(1879) whose descriptions note greater differences between some of the cultivars, that Whitney et al. (1939)
lumped together, than can be attributed to environmental
influences (Winter, Field Notes 2003-2012). It is likely that

Winter - Kalo [Hawaiian Taro, Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott] Varieties:
An assessment of nomenclatural synonymy and biodiversity
the high level of synonymy (80%) reported by Whitney et
al. (1939) is not representative of the level of synonymy
that existed at the height of cultivation. This figure is in
fact substantially higher than any of the other authors who
documented synonymy (6-26%), as well as Whitney et
al.’s (1939) own stated estimate of 50%.
MacCaughey and Emerson (1913) were the first to put
forward an estimate of kalo diversity at the height of cultivation. They asserted (presumably using their 50% synonymy estimate) that there may have been between 150175 cultivars represented by approximately half of the
names they collected. Handy et al. (1972) represented
perhaps the most thorough examination of kalo ethnobotany, and estimated that there was once at least 300
cultivars. They qualify that there was a relatively small
number of culturally salient cultivars that could be found
throughout the Hawaiian islands, and further attribute the
remainder of the diversity to the high number of localized
cultivars occurring as endemics within various districts.
Despite these estimates, there has been some hesitation
to accept either of them because of the complex synonymy found within traditional kalo taxonomy. As a result
of this hesitation there is no general agreement on even
an approximate number of cultivars at the height of kalo
diversity, although the diversity is generally qualified as
high.
Iokepa and Kekahuna (n.d.) documented 92 varietal
names that are the most accurate collection in terms of
adherence to Hawaiian binomial-nomenclature trends. Iokepa was a lifelong kalo farmer, and well-respected elder of his area while Kekahuna was a learned Hawaiian
who dedicated his life to documenting Hawaiian knowledge systems. Kekahuna’s method was to seek out the
most well-respected elders in a given area and document
their knowledge (Kekahuna 1956). An analysis of Iokepa
and Kekahuna’s varietal list shows 26% synonymy. The
sample size (92) and the level of cultural knowledge attributed to both Iokepa and Kekahuna points to a high
level of accuracy. It is likely that 26% represents the best
approximation for the actual synonymy level that existed
at or near the height of kalo cultivation and, therefore, will
henceforth be called the “26% Rule”.
Secondary to the Iokepa and Kekahuna (n.d.) manuscript,
is the work of Chun (1994). It also represents a high level
of cultural knowledge in that the manuscript was a collaborative effort among kahuna lāʻau lapaʻau (highly skilled
herbal healers) who are considered plant experts within
the culture. Chun (1994) does not contain a comprehensive list of kalo varieties, but rather a list of 31 varieties
that are used medicinally. Chun (1994) is considered secondary to Iokepa and Kekahuna (n.d.) because the report is of a relatively small subset of varieties. However,
Chun (1994) does support Iokepa and Kekahuna’s (n.d.)
binomial nomenclature system, as well as synonymy level (29%), which will henceforth be called the “29% Rule”.

433

Part of the discrepancy between the three rules may stem
from the sources accounting for different classes of synonymy. Perhaps, the 50% Rule proposed by MacCaughey
and Emerson (1939) and Whitney et al. (1939) stems
from adding both linguistically-based and classificationbased synonyms together. Either way, there is no data
that support this estimate so it will not be used in further
analysis. The other two rules—26% based on Iokepa and
Kekahuna (n.d.), and 29% based on Chun (1994)—clearly only relate to classification-based synonymy. When the
26% Rule and the 29% Rule were applied to the list of
512 linguistically-consolidated names, an initial estimate
was obtained which produced a possible range of 364379 distinct cultivars. This maybe a good starting point
for estimating a conservative and liberal range of kalo diversity; however this is just a cursory analysis. Therefore,
this work puts forth a more systematic approach using linguistic tools, in concert with trends in ethnonomenclature
and ethnoclassification (Berlin 1992), to assess diversity.
Taxonomic and Nomenclature Trends
As Berlin (1992) points out, human cultures, have systemized ways of classifying the biological world around
them. Hawaiian culture is no exception. The system laid
out by Berlin seems to describe well the way in which
Hawaiians apply classification, taxonomy and nomenclature. Hawaiian nomenclature at the finest level is mostly
binomial. Names applied to kalo cultivars in Hawaiʻi correspond to Berlin (1992) (Table 4).
About 92% of the 652 recorded kalo varietal names are
binomials (or mononomials that fit into a binomial system). This certainly confirms to the binomial trend seen in
publications produced in collaboration with herbal healers
(Chun 1994, 1998, Gon 2008), and recognized by botanists who studied Hawaiian nomenclature systems (St.
John 1982). Only two (2)% (14 names) of the entire collection are trinomials. There are three likely explanations
for these trinomials:
1. They are names that were incorrectly recorded.
2. They reflect the extreme importance of kalo to Hawaiian culture resulting in development of a taxonomic level below subspecies.
3. They are a part of a taxonomic system created by
scientists who did not adhere to Hawaiian nomenclature traditions.
Seven of 14 (50%) of the recorded trinomials are found
in (Whitney et al. 1939). The others could be either misspellings, or debatable binomials. Whitney et al. (1939)
admittedly created a system that achieved their goal of
a dichotomous key, and this could have included creating the trinomials seen in the lauloa group (Appendix 1).
The remaining 5% of names are questionable, poetic
names that stem mostly from Henriques (n.d.). These are

www.ethnobotanyjournal.org/vol10/i1547-3465-10-423.pdf

434

Ethnobotany Research & Applications

likely to be proper names of kalo-based characters in stories rather than cultivar names.
Nomenclature Trends at the Species
and Subspecies Levels
Different trends emerged regarding naming at both the
species and subspecies level. Species-level names include monomials with no clear relationship to other cultivars, and the group name for a set of binomials. In regards to monomials, many have no documented meaning
or obvious source. These, perhaps, represent taxa that
were named after people (Handy 1940). For the remainder of the monomials, a few have religious connotations
indicating a possible role in ceremony. The remaining monomials indicate a strong tendency for either naming after
a morphological resemblance to something in nature (reef
fish, forest plant, forest bird, or other cultivated plants).
If the name is binomial there is a pattern of the group
name (i.e., species-level name for a set of subspecies)
being given due to common morphological trait (such as
branching-corm, or long-leaf) or other characteristic of the
group (such as fragrant-when-cooked, or predominantlyblack petiole).
In examining the subspecies epithets a different trend
emerges. The majority (60%) of the subspecies epithets
are color designations. This indicates that the ancient Hawaiians taxonomically grouped kalo together according
to a common morphological trait, and separated out individuals that were different color variants of that common
trait. About 16% of subspecies are either specifically indicated with the epithet, maoli, or otherwise assumed to be
classified as such. “Maoli,” is defined in Hawaiian as “Native, indigenous, aborigine, genuine, true, real, or actual”
(Pukui & Elbert 1986:240). In effect, this is a Hawaiian
term for the original or type specimen. The data reflects
that subspecies outside of this type specimen are generally distinguished from one another by the predominant
petiole coloring. This might indicate that the type-specimen is the original form from which somatic mutations
produced subspecies that retain the general morphology,
but differ in petiole color. If so, then the most common
mutation colors are (in descending order) blackish, whitish, reddish, yellowish, and purplish (Table 5). Since it is
likely that many have gone extinct, and the remaining cultivars represent a severe genetic bottleneck, so we can
only speculate about whether or not the data reflect a genetic reality.
The Relationship of Reduplications and
Backformations in Synonymy
While this paper identifies synonymy trends in data, it is
beyond the scope to identify the linguistic foundations of
this synonymy (such as various kinds of vowel substitutions and consonant substitutions). However, the relationship between reduplications or backformations is one

form of synonymy that may be explored since it directly
relates to physical morphologies differentiating taxa (Figure 2).
The question naturally arises, which came first the reduplication or the backformation (and how does this relate
to why these taxa were named as such). Ross (2008) observed that, in Proto Oceanic (an evolutionary precursor
to Hawaiian), reduplications were common when naming
a plant that resembles another is some way, but is not the
original. In Figure 2, Hāpuʻu and Hāpuʻupuʻu are treated
as synonyms. Hāpuʻu is a native tree fern (Cibotium spp.).
It has a dark trunk and green fronds. The kalo of the same
name (kalo Hāpuʻu) has dark petioles and green leaves.
The kalo was named in reference to the tree fern. If the
trends of Proto Oceanic carry forward into the Hawaiian
language, then the original name given to the kalo would
have been Hāpuʻupuʻu as it resembles, but is clearly not
the tree fern. Over time, presumably for ease of pronunciation, a backformation likely took place, making Hāpuʻu a
synonym for the original, Hāpuʻupuʻu. The second example in Figure 2, Pia and Piapia cannot be confirmed since
Piapia is extinct and unavailable for morphological analysis. However, if the above example is correct then Piapia
might have been a kalo with a taste/consistency (or other
character) that resembled Pia (T. leontopetaloides), and
was therefore called Piapia. Over time, presumably for
ease of pronunciation, a backformation took place, making Pia a synonym for the original form, Piapia.
Changes in Nomenclature and Taxonomy
Given the language shift in Hawaiʻi which went from Hawaiian as the only language, to Hawaiian as a second
language, and going as far as English as the only language for the majority of Hawaiians, it can be predicted
that there would also be associated shifts in nomenclature
and taxonomy of biological taxa. There is evidence to support this. All indications are that Hawaiians used a binomial system until the mid-20th century when a horticulturalist-based understanding of kalo diversity began to fill the
knowledge void left as more and more Hawaiian-speaking
farmers passed away, and their knowledge of Hawaiian
nomenclature and taxonomy was lost to time.

Winter - Kalo [Hawaiian Taro, Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott] Varieties:
An assessment of nomenclatural synonymy and biodiversity
Whitney et al. (1939) is currently the authoritative work
used in Hawaiʻi botanical gardens and agriculture stations
to distinguish the cultivars in their collections. Historically,
these gardens and stations, not Hawaiian-speaking farmers, have been sources of planting material used by farmers desiring to enhance the diversity within their collections. Because of this, nomenclature and taxonomic systems currently used in Hawaiʻi have been heavily influenced by Whitney et al. (1939). An example of their influence is the proliferation of trinomials that were previously
rare or nonexistent. The results of this study propose that
trinomials represent only 2% of all the varietal names collected, but are currently applied to 11% of extant varieties.
Whitney et al. (1939) are the first to report trinomials with
the Lauloa palakea group (L. p. ʻeleʻele, L. p. keʻokeʻo,
L. p. papamū, and L. p. ʻula) and the variety Piko lehua
ʻāpiʻi. They alluded to the challenges they had in creating
their taxonomic treatment, and indicated that they created
trinomials as a solution. Their treatment lists binomial synonyms for all but one of these trinomials, and it is likely
that these binomials were the actual names used by Hawaiians before 1939.
Whitney et al.’s (1939) influence over contemporary taxonomy and nomenclature is further evidenced in an examination of other varietal names. For example, the variety name Makaʻōpio was once commonly used, as is
evident from the high number of sources that documented
its presence (Table 7). However, it is treated as a secondary synonym to Piko ʻeleʻele (Whitney et al. 1939) which
was documented by only five sources. Evidence suggests
that the varietal name, Makaʻōpio, was once more commonly used than Piko ʻeleʻele, but today Piko ʻeleʻele is
the only name that is used and Makaʻōpio has fallen out
of use. From the above examples it is seen that Whitney

et al. (1939) created a uniform nomenclature and taxonomic system that worked for their purposes, and it has
had an influence on the nomenclature and taxonomic system used in Hawaiʻi today.
Aside from the changes in nomenclature and taxonomy
articulated above there is evidence that other changes may have occurred. One piece of evidence comes
from reviewing nomenclature for other Hawaiian crop
plants with relatively high levels of recognized diversity—such as sweet potato, bananas, and ʻawa (Handy
1940, Kalanianaʻole n.d.). Although these crops do have
species-level taxa that are named after colors (eg., ʻawa
Hiwa, maiʻa ʻEleʻele), these species names represent the
finest level of diversity associated with those genera, and
do not correspond with group-names at the species levels. However, within the review of kalo group-names (Appendix 1), a few colors—ʻEleʻele (blackish), ʻUlaʻula (reddish), and Poni (purplish)—are seen. This deviation from
the nomenclatural trend for Hawaiian crop plants makes
these groups intriguing. Synonyms within the system (Table 8) imply traditions that are more consistent with the
trends of other Hawaiian crop plants. These names were
lumped together for the “conservative estimate” of kalo
diversity. The color synonyms may be evidence that higher kalo diversity persisted into the period when the Hawaiian language, and thus knowledge of traditional nomenclature, was in decline. It is possible that these color
group-names represent an evolution of kalo nomenclature corresponding to the 19th century, although there is
not enough evidence to definitively determine the validity
of this.
Decrease in Traditional Diversity and
Effects on Cultural Diversity
No individual cultivars documented previously (18791940) as common are still common today (Table 7). Reduction of diversity since this period is further evidenced
by examining the most diverse subspecies-groups of the
past and comparing them with contemporary levels of diversity. Diversity within these groups have declined drastically (Table 9). Since individual cultivars and subspeciesgroups have specific, and sometimes unique, traditions
associated with them, it can be predicted that relative kalo-based traditions will shift over time with shifting levels
of biodiversity. For example, the variety, Nohu, was once
one of the most common in the period from 1879-1940
(Table 7). We could assume that specific traditions assoTable 8. Kalo (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott.) color

ciated with that variety were also common. Today, Nohu
is a varietal name that is not even used anymore which
is an indication that specific traditions associated with it
are no longer practiced. If this trend were to be applied at
the scale of interactions between all of kalo diversity and
all of Hawaiian cultural-practices, it is predicted that shifts
in biodiversity and cultural diversity will be linked. Such
coupled changes relating to shifts in biodiversity and associated traditions are examples of ethnobiological evolution (Winter & McClatchey 2008, 2009). This presents an
opportunity for further research.
Increases in Diversity via Modern Hybrids
Thousands of modern cultivars have been created via
hybridization between Hawaiian and other Pacific and
Asian cultivars since the 1980s (Cho et al. 2007, QueroGarcía et al. 2009). Lack of rigorous morphological documentation of these hybrids and their distributions is currently confusing identification, and stimulating controversy about whether or not these new hybrids are beneficial
contributions to Hawaiian culture.

Conclusions
The data collection activities reported in the literature
(1879-1940) and by the author were conducted in reaction to declining kalo diversity and associated cultural
knowledge. Sorting through synonymy is complex, which
is why there has been no consensus about levels of biodiversity at or near the period of peak of cultivation. The
methods used to sort through synonymy presented in this
paper are useful in estimating, but may not be enough for
an accurate picture of the past due to insufficient positive

records of cultivar names. Genetic tools could more accurately sort through the cultivars, however, since the majority have apparently gone extinct, the methods used in this
study may represent the best that we have.
Estimates of a conservative and liberal range for former
levels of kalo diversity were determined using two different methods. The first method, using synonymy percentages calculated by analyzing the most valid sources, provided a cursory estimate of 364-379 cultivars. This was
followed by a more methodological approach of sorting
through both linguistically-based and classification-based
synonyms resulted in an estimate of 368-482 cultivars. It
is important to note that there is only a difference of four
between the two different methodologies of conservatively estimating kalo diversity, which is cross validation that
these estimates may be accurate. This far surpasses previous estimates of 100-150 (MacCaughey & Emerson’s
1913), and supports Handy et al.’s (1972) estimate of at
least 300. The above estimates may still be low, however,
due to missing information. The above estimate is of the
level of biodiversity at the end of the 19th century. Assuming that the height of kalo diversity was approximately 100
years earlier, and given all the circumstances, it seems
safe to assume that levels at the height of diversity at the
end of the 18th century were even higher.
The high number of cultivars far surpasses those of other crop plants and reinforces the idea that kalo was indeed the most important crop plant in Hawaiian culture.
The only other crop which rivals this level of diversity is the
sweet potato (I. batatas). Emerging research (Ladefoged
et al. 2009) is showing that sweet potatoes may have had
more prominence within ancient Hawaiian culture at the
point of contact in 1778 than most contemporary scholars
have thought. Further research could apply the methods
articulated here to a collection of sweet potato names.
Field surveys have confirmed that there are only between
65-73 kalo cultivars remaining in Hawaiʻi. Using the most
conservative estimate above these field surveys indicate
that there has been approximately an 80% extinction rate
since the late 19th century. Due to the extent with which
various individuals and institutions have worked to collect
all remaining kalo diversity for the past century, it is broadly assumed that all other cultivars have been lost to extinction. However, extinction of kalo cultivars may not be a
permanent status. Another team of researchers has located the previously undocumented, Piʻikea; and reportedly
rediscovered the cultivar, Lauloa ʻōniʻoniʻo, via a somatic
mutation. This rediscovery is not yet confirmed, but it does
give hope that some of the lost cultivars can be regained.
An interesting and unforeseen outcome of this research
is that we now also have insight into which individual cultivars and which taxonomic groups of kalo were the most
important at or near the period of peak cultivation. None
of these individual cultivars or taxonomic groups have the

Winter - Kalo [Hawaiian Taro, Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott] Varieties:

same status today as they once did. All have experienced
a drastic decline, and other commercial cultivars have taken their place. Given that each heritage cultivar has specific associated traditions relating to cultivation, preparation and ceremony; and that there has been both a decline
in diversity, and a shift away from formerly important cultivars; then the role of kalo in Hawaiian culture has likely
changed over time, and is an example of ethnobiological
evolution. Such a phenomenon presents an interesting
area for further research. It may be possible to quantify
the amount of cultural loss that has been associated with
a decline in kalo diversity.
Whitney et al.’s (1939) research has been an instrumental
component to scientifically documenting and understanding kalo diversity, but the data and analysis provided by
this paper demonstrates that they did change varietal
nomenclature (i.e., creating trinomials) to create a taxonomic treatment and subsequent dichotomous key that
worked for their purposes. Their nomenclatural and taxonomic treatment of kalo is founded in, but has deviated
from, an originally Hawaiian world view of kalo. Furthermore, due to a shift away from the Hawaiian language
by the general population there is not a firm understanding of nomenclature and classification within the Hawaiian lexicon. This, coupled with the contemporary reliance
on Whitney et al. (1939) in understanding kalo diversity
seems to be the largest factor for the contemporary shift
away from an unadulterated Hawaiian nomenclature and
taxonomic system. The most accurate example of Hawaiian nomenclature and taxonomy is seen the work of Iokepa and Kekahuna (n.d.) and Chun (1994).

It is entirely possible that yet more data may be uncovered
relating to kalo diversity which may cause us to rethink
the conclusions of this paper. The hope is that for now, the
additional data, new forms of analysis, and conclusions of
this paper will respectfully reawaken a debate about kalo
diversity and its role in the evolving Hawaiian culture.
