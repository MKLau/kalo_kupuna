Abstract
Taro, Colocasia esculenta, is one of the world’s oldest root crops and is of particular economic and
cultural significance in Hawai’i, where historically more than 150 different landraces were grown.
We developed a genome-wide set of more than 2400 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) markers from 70 taro accessions of Hawaiian, South Pacific, Palauan, and mainland Asian
origins, with several objectives: 1) uncover the phylogenetic relationships between Hawaiian and
other Pacific landraces, 2) shed light on the history of taro cultivation in Hawai’i, and 3) develop a
tool to discriminate among Hawaiian and other taros. We found that almost all existing Hawaiian
landraces fall into 5 monophyletic groups that are largely consistent with the traditional Hawaiian
classification based on morphological characters, for example, leaf shape and petiole color. Genetic
diversity was low within these clades but considerably higher between them. Population structure
analyses further indicated that the diversification of taro in Hawai’i most likely occurred by a
combination of frequent somatic mutation and occasional hybridization. Unexpectedly, the South
Pacific accessions were found nested within the clades mainly composed of Hawaiian accessions,
rather than paraphyletic to them. This suggests that the origin of clades identified here preceded
the colonization of Hawai’i and that early Polynesian settlers brought taro landraces from different
clades with them. In the absence of a sequenced genome, this marker set provides a valuable
resource towards obtaining a genetic linkage map and to study the genetic basis of phenotypic
traits of interest to taro breeding such as disease resistance.

in Hawaiian), 2) Piko (with leaf blades cut to the petiole attachment or piko), 3) Kāī (with pendant leaves), (4) Lauloa (meaning
‘long leaf’, with large leaves), 5) ‘Ele‘ele (‘ele meaning ‘dark’, referring to the petiole), 6) ‘Ula‘ula (‘ula meaning ‘red’, referring to the
petiole), 7) Manini (with striped petioles, named after the convict
tang Acanthurus triostegus, a striped fish), and 8) Lehua (with
reddish-purple corm color, similar to the flower of the ‘Ōhi‘a tree,
Metrosideros polymorpha).
Despite the cultural importance of taro in Hawai‘i, production
has steadily declined over the 20th century, with the current area
under cultivation approximately one third of what it was in 1900
(Cho et al. 2007). However, interest in growing taro is increasing,
mostly due to the cultural revitalization efforts of native Hawaiian
communities, and the recognition of taro as a medicinal crop (Brown
et al. 2005; Reyad-ul-Ferdous et al. 2015). Total production of taro
in Hawai‘i for 2015 was valued at $2.4 million, up from $1.9 million in 2014 (USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service 2015),
and this market may further increase as taro remains very popular
in Hawaiian cuisine.
The use of different taro landraces has been a part of Hawaiian
agriculture and society for centuries. Understanding the relationships among the different landraces, modern cultivars, and hybrids
is thus essential to creating both breeding and conservation plans.
Efforts to preserve the original Hawaiian landraces will benefit
from using DNA-based methods for genetic stock identification,
a goal that proved previously intractable using unpublished SSR
data (Supplementary Material and Supplementary Tables S1 and
S2). Moreover, despite the extraordinary variety of landraces and
dramatic subsequent losses since the time of first European contact,
a genome-wide exploration of genetic relatedness and diversity of
Hawaiian taro is still missing. To fill this gap, this study aims to
investigate the phylogenetic relationships among the majority of
extant Hawaiian landraces, as well as other Pacific and Asian taro
lineages. In doing so, we also sought to elucidate the cultivation
history of taro in Hawai‘i, evaluate and update the morphologybased classification system proposed by Whitney et al. (1939) using
genetic data, and determine if a subset of genetic markers developed in this study could be used to efficiently identify Hawaiian
landraces. In addition, the present dataset may prove valuable to
advance previous efforts using SNP markers to construct a genetic
linkage map of taro (Soulard et al. 2017), and study resistance
against diseases threatening taro production around the world
(Shintaku et al. 2016).

Materials and Methods
Sample Collection, DNA Extraction and Sequencing
A total of 77 taro accessions—63 of Hawaiian, 6 of South Pacific,
6 of Palauan, and 2 of mainland Asian origin—were sourced from
the germplasm collections at Moloka‘i and Hawai‘i Islands and subjected to genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS, Elshire et al. 2011). These
“pure-lineage” accessions represent the majority of old Hawaiian
landraces in existence today, as well as all extant, morphologically
recognized groups of Hawaiian taro (Whitney et al. 1939). In contrast, the South Pacific and Asian landraces and cultivars were introduced to Hawai‘i more recently, after the arrival of European and
Asian immigrants.
Concurrently, 2 additional, previously unpublished datasets
were produced and used here to improve single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling: 1) GBS data of 113 Hawaiian hybrid
cultivars, raising the total number of GBS samples to 190, and

Taro, Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott, has served as a food source
for an estimated 28 000 years (Loy et al. 1992) and is an ancient
crop, cultivated for over 9000 years (Rao et al. 2010). Ranking
among the world’s most important root crops, its starchy underground stem or corm serves as a staple food in many tropical and
subtropical areas, where it is grown across a large range of environments (Caillon et al. 2006). Typically, taro is grown using vegetative
propagules rather than from seed, because most areas of the world
where it is cultivated lack the specialized insects that serve as natural pollinators.
Taro is believed to have originated in the Indo-Malayan region,
although it is unclear whether domestication occurred once or multiple times. The distribution of natural pollinators, and of species in
the genus Colocasia itself, point to northeast India, Southeast Asia,
or New Guinea as the origin of taro as a species (Matthews 1995).
Widespread distribution of wild taro may have facilitated multiple, independent domestication events in India, Southern China,
Melanesia, and northern Australia (Lebot 2009; Chaïr et al. 2016).
Asian taros display the greatest genetic diversity, a trend consistently
observed across RAPD markers (Irwin et al. 1998), isozymes (Lebot
and Aradhya 1991), AFLP markers (Kreike et al. 2004; Lebot et al.
2004), and microsatellites (Chaïr et al. 2016). Within the Pacific
Island region, a comprehensive survey of taro germplasm identified
the greatest genetic diversity in accessions from New Guinea and
the Solomon Islands (Mace et al. 2006). With multiple ploidy levels
(2n=2x=28, 2n=3x=42, and 2n=4x=56), mainland Asia is supported
also as a center of domestication by cytological evidence, whereas
only diploids are found in the Pacific Islands (Coates et al. 1988;
Kreike et al. 2004).
Despite the Asiatic origins of taro, it is not a staple crop in mainland Asia. In fact, it is much more important historically in the South
and East Pacific (Onwueme 1999; Rao et al. 2010). Humans have
formed strong cultural connections to taro, especially in the epistemology of the peoples of the Pacific Islands. For example, taro is
considered the “mother of life” in Palau and is an important food
to share with people in gatherings on special occasions in American
Samoa (Tipton et al. 1993). In many other Pacific Islands, taro is
used as part of religious ceremonies, celebrations, and funerals. The
dispersal history of taro in the Pacific has not been studied systematically, but there is evidence of taro cultivation during the Lapita era
(ca. 3050–2500 years BP) as far east as Fiji (Horrocks and Nunn
2007). Taro was brought to Hawai‘i by Polynesian seafarers, who
most likely settled Hawai‘i between 1000 and 1250 AD (Wilmshurst
et al. 2011; Kirch 2014) and used it as a staple food during their
expansion across the Pacific. Known as “kalo” in Hawaiian, taro is
deeply bound to Hawaiian culture, with specific landraces having
particular uses as food, medicine, or in religious ceremonies (Handy
1940; Abbott 1992). The significance of taro in Hawai‘i is attested to
by its prominent position in the creation chant Kumulipo (Beckwith
1951).
Due to extensive cultivation, more than 150 landraces of taro
were estimated to have existed in Hawai‘i prior to European contact. Of these, approximately 70 have been preserved and are grown
alongside cultivars and landraces—lineages that have and have not
undergone modern breeding, respectively—more recently introduced
from the South Pacific and mainland Asia. Drawing on a collection
of 84 distinct taro accessions (69 native to Hawai‘i), Whitney et al.
(1939) developed a classification system that mostly maintained traditional Hawaiian group names based on origin, use and vegetative
morphology. The eight main groups according to this system are 1)

SNP Calling and Filtering
Preliminary SNP calling was conducted using GBS data from all 190
samples with the UNEAK pipeline (Lu et al. 2013) implemented
in TASSEL v3.0.160. Parameters employed in this analysis are
described in Supplementary Table S3. The dataset was subsequently
reduced to the 77 pure-lineage samples, and after filtering sites by
minor allele frequency ≥0.1 and minimum mean depth of ≥10 reads
using VCFtools v0.1.14 (Danecek et al. 2011), 70 samples with more
than 400 sites were retained (Table 1).
In a second step, a de novo reference was assembled from all
GBS and RAD-seq data combined using IDBA-UD v1.1.2 (Peng et
al. 2012). GBS reads of all samples were aligned to the reference
with bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) using a minimum
alignment length of 48 nt, followed by SNP calling using TASSEL
v5.2.17 (Bradbury et al. 2007, GBS v2 pipeline). This dataset was
subset to contain the same 70 samples identified during preliminary
SNP calling. Further filtering steps were then performed on the basis
of per-site sequencing depth, data missingness, and site-specific heterozygosity. Sequencing depth and data missingness were calculated
using VCFtools, while site-specific heterozygosity was calculated
with the VariantsToTable tool included in GATK v3.6 (McKenna
et al. 2010). Data were visualized as 3D plots using the R package plot3D (Soetaert 2016). Excessive heterozygosity was observed
for higher read depths, likely because different forms of repeats
map to the same reference contig. Thus, SNPs exceeding 200 persite sequencing depth were excluded from the final analysis. Per-site
sequencing depth minimum was set to 10 reads, and maximum genotype missingness to 20%.
Last, the remaining SNPs were filtered by allele characteristics
using VCFtools, applying a range of thresholds regarding minor
allele count (mac) and minor allele frequency (maf). A threshold
of mac ≥ 2 was finally chosen for providing good balance between
the number of SNPs and allelic diversity (Supplementary Table S4),
yielding 2447 high-quality SNPs. Additional datasets were obtained
using the same filtering parameters as outlined above by constructing
alternative references from a subset of GBS data only, and publicly
available taro transcriptome data. However, these datasets provided
fewer SNPs and lower phylogenetic resolution (see Supplementary
Material and Supplementary Tables S5 and S6) than the primary
dataset.

Phylogenetic Analyses and Classification
To reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among accessions,
we conducted maximum likelihood analyses with RAxML v8.1.16
(Stamatakis 2014). The data was first converted from VCF to FASTA
format using NGSToolsApp.jar v2.1.5 (Duitama et al. 2014), considering only 2088 homozygous positions (heterozygous sites were
replaced with unknown values). The best tree of 100 maximum likelihood inferences starting from randomized maximum parsimony
trees was outfitted with confidence values derived from 1000 regular bootstrap replicates. Both final maximum likelihood inferences
and bootstrapping runs were performed under the GTRCAT model.
Trees were drawn with iTOL v3 (Letunic and Bork 2016, http://
itol.embl.de). Clade composition inferred by phylogenetic analyses
was compared to the classification system developed by Whitney et
al. (1939), and the phylogenetic distribution of morphological traits
assumed to be diagnostic was evaluated.
To visualize phylogenetic conflict and uncertainty in the data,
network-based analyses were conducted with SplitsTree v4.14.2
(Huson and Bryant 2006), using the NeighborNet approach under
the Jukes-Cantor model. Bootstrap networks were computed based
on 250 bootstrap replicates. Population splits and admixture events
between populations were assessed using TreeMix v1.12 (Pickrell
and Pritchard 2012). For the latter, input files were prepared using
NGSToolsApp.jar v2.1.5, assigning samples to one of seven populations as inferred by the RAxML analyses above. Maximum likelihood trees were built assuming 0, 1, 2, and 3 migration events,
respectively.

Genetic Differentiation and Population Structure
Overall genetic similarity among accessions was assessed by principal component analysis (PCA). First, SNP data was converted from
VCF to PLINK format using Plink v1.9 (Chang et al. 2015), coding
half-calls as missing data. Principal components were then computed
and plotted with the packages adegenet (Jombart 2008) and ade4
(Dray and Dufour 2007) in R.
Population structure was analyzed with the program
STRUCTURE v2.3.4 (Pritchard et al. 2000). SNP data filtered by
maf ≥ 0.1 instead of the default mac ≥ 2 was used here, consisting of
1030 SNPs. VCF files were converted to STRUCTURE format files
by PGDSpider v2.1.0.0 (Lischer and Excoffier 2012). Cluster (K)
values were set to 2 through 10, and 5 iterations each were run with
a burn-in period of 10 000 and Markov chain Monte Carlo repetitions set to 50 000. Results were uploaded to the Structure Harvester
website (Earl et al. 2012, http://taylor0.biology.ucla.edu/structureHarvester/) where an optimal K was calculated using the Evanno
method (Evanno et al. 2005), although we also considered the number of clades found by phylogenetic analysis to evaluate the informativeness of K values. STRUCTURE results were also uploaded to the
CLUMPAK main pipeline (Kopelman et al. 2015, http://clumpak.
tau.ac.il/index.html) for visualization and output. CLUMPAK provided singular membership coefficients for each cluster, calculated
over all 5 iterations per K and individual. Assignment to clusters was
compared to known membership in phylogenetic clades.

2) restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq, Davey
and Blaxter 2010) data obtained from cultivars #230 and #255
(Shintaku et al. 2016), as well as two pools of their progeny
which were resistant and non-resistant to Taro Leaf Blight (TLB),
respectively.
Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh or freeze-dried leaf tissue using the Qiagen Plant DNeasy Mini kit or Macherey-Nagel
Nucleospin Plant II kit according to each manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries for both GBS and RAD-seq were prepared using the
restriction enzyme PstI. GBS was conducted at Cornell University’s
Genomic Diversity Facility (Ithaca, NY) on 2 flow cell lanes of
an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 100 bp single end reads. Across all
190 GBS samples, approximately 410 million usable reads were
obtained. RAD-seq was performed at Floragenex (Portland, OR)
on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx system. Parent and progeny
libraries were sequenced during two separate runs on one flow cell
lane each, using 95 bp paired-end and single reads, respectively, and
which yielded 95 million reads. The software GBSX v1.1.4 (Herten
et al. 2015) was applied to demultiplex and trim barcodes from both
GBS and RAD-seq data.

Genetic Differentiation and Population Structure

classification system based on shared morphological characters

Consistent with the broad phylogenetic pattern, mapping the genetic
similarity among samples by principal component analysis (PCA)
revealed low genetic diversity in several clades, and clear differentiation among clades (Figure 2). The first principal component, which
accounted for 16.3% of the total variation, separated a tightly clustered group composed of the Lehua accessions from all others. The
second principal component, accounting for 7.6% of the total variation, isolated Lauloa-Manini from all other accessions. The remaining accessions were separated more gradually along both axes, and
thus exhibited higher within-clade diversity, but still formed clusters
consistent with phylogenetic clades, displaying no or only moderate
overlap between groups. The PCA also supported Lauloa-Manini
consisting of 2 distinct sub-groups, Lauloa and Manini (compare
Supplementary Figure S1).
To assess the genetic structure among Hawaiian taros in more
detail and identify admixture between clades and individual accessions, we applied the Bayesian inference program STRUCTURE
(Pritchard et al. 2000). This method assigns samples to one (or
proportionally to several, in the case of admixture) of K clusters
based on the allele frequencies across all loci, without relying on
prior knowledge of ancestry or origin. We found a primary partition between a cluster of accessions corresponding to clade Lehua,
and all remaining accessions at K = 3 (Figure 3). A secondary split
between accessions of the Lauloa-Manini clade and all other accessions was becoming notable at this K, which was deemed optimal
by the post-hoc Evanno statistic (Evanno et al. 2005) for most runs.
However, in line with the phylogenetic results, increasing K resulted
in the further separation of the ‘Ula‘ula, Mana and Palauan accessions (K = 5). Additional, unambiguous clusters did not emerge
beyond K = 6, which matched our intuition based on the number
of clades recovered phylogenetically. While all clades were identifiable by a distinct pattern of group membership coefficients (proportions), only Lehua and Lauloa-Manini (in particular the subgroup
Lauloa) accessions were defined by high membership coefficients
for a single cluster. Similar results were achieved using datasets generated by alternative SNP calling methods (Supplementary Figure
S5). Further support for hybridization between clades was obtained
by inferring admixture events using the TreeMix software, most
notably between ‘Ula‘ula and the Manini subgroup (Supplementary
Figure S6).
Regarding individual landraces, several accessions stood out by
displaying strong signatures of admixture. In line with the phylogenetic results, this admixture signal applied to the unclassifiable

(Whitney et al. 1939), which is largely in agreement with our
phylogenetic results (Table 1). The Palauan accessions formed an
additional clade, while the two Asian accessions were defined as
the root. Bootstrap support for clades was generally high, especially with regard to the Palauan, Lauloa-Manini, and Kāī groups.
The ‘Ula‘ula and Lehua groups were also recovered consistently,
although more divergent accessions (e.g. ‘O‘opukai in ‘Ula‘ula)
seemed to suppress the support values for their clades. The Mana
group was moderately supported by the primary dataset (Figure
1), but appeared paraphyletic in some analyses using alternative
datasets (Supplementary Figure S1). The latter also suggests that
the Lauloa-Manini clade may consist of 2 smaller clades, Lauloa
and Manini, in a sister-group relationship.
The six accessions of South Pacific Origin were found firmly
embedded in clades otherwise consisting of Hawaiian landraces
(Figure 1): Tahitian and Mana Uliuli grouped with Mana, Kakakura
and Niue ‘Ula‘ula with ‘Ula‘ula, and Akuugawai with LauloaManini. Only 2 accessions, ‘Āweu and False Lihilihimōlina, could
not be assigned reliably to any clade. The membership of accessions
in phylogenetic clades, along with their traditional, morphologybased classification, is given in Table 1.
In contrast to the high confidence obtained for the clades,
the backbone of the tree, i.e., the relationship between clades,
remained unresolved as indicated by a lack of bootstrap support values greater than 50 at the deeper nodes. This pattern
of well-defined clades and a lack of resolution between clades
was also reflected in the NeighborNet analyses that showed distinct subgraphs for each clade emanating from a star-like center
(Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Resolution within clades
was found to range from moderate (e.g., Mana, Palauan) to low
(Lehua, ‘Ula‘ula, and parts of Lauloa-Manini). Weak resolution in
the clades was exacerbated by some accessions displaying nearly
identical genotypes in the primary dataset (1–3 allelic differences;
1 pair appeared identical). However, due to the relatively high
number of undetermined positions in these accessions, the true
number of differences is likely to be higher. Since Manini Kea and
Piko ‘Ele‘ele, the only genotypically indistinguishable accessions,
are also morphologically very distinct, we assume no identical
clones exist in this dataset.

whose phylogenetic position as part of the ‘Ula‘ula clade was only
weakly supported (Figure 1). Other accessions characterized by signatures of admixture and long branches in the phylogenetic tree
included Lauloa Ke‘oke‘o, Pa‘akai, Wehiwa, Lehua ‘Ele‘ele, and

Figure 2. Principal component analysis (PCA) of 70 taro accessions based
on 2447 high-quality SNPs. Strong genetic differentiation is apparent
between the Lehua group and all other accessions (first component, 16.3%
of variation), and between the Lauloa–Manini group and the remaining
accessions (second component, 7.6% of variation). Colors highlight clade
membership following Figure 1, with oval outlines indicating 95% inertia
ellipses. The inset shows the relative eigenvalues of the first 20 principal
components, with the represented components in black.

We observed that the Hawaiian taro landraces contain sufficient
genetic variation across the genome to discriminate among the majority of accessions, and identify several well-demarcated clades using
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1). The composition of these clades
largely parallels the traditional classification based on morphological characters such as petiole color, leaf shape, and corm shape and
color (Whitney et al. 1939, Table 1). For instance, as defined morphologically, the ‘Ula‘ula group is characterized by red petioles (‘ula
meaning red in Hawaiian). Accessions regarded as group members
(carrying binomial names beginning with ‘Ula‘ula) indeed proved
to be closely related to each other, forming a monophyletic group
together with accessions considered loose affiliates due to partially
red petioles by Whitney et al. (1939). Similarly, Mana, Kāī, Lauloa,
and Manini (the last two joined in a single clade, Lauloa-Manini, but
with unclear relations to each other) were also found to be largely
natural groups, with diagnostic morphological traits—the division
of the parent corm into several branches (Mana), pendant leaf position (Kāī), large leaves (Lauloa), and striped petioles (Manini)—
being mostly confined to one clade. This suggests that these traits are

South Pacific and Unaffiliated Accessions
Interestingly, several accessions collected in 1927 by G. P. Wilder
in the South Pacific were found nested within Mana, ‘Ula‘ula and
Lauloa-Manini (Figure 1, indicated by asterisks). This circumstance
has important implications for the cultivation history of Hawaiian
taro. If the Hawaiian landraces had diversified from a single genotype, or only a few closely related ones, we would expect the South
Pacific accessions to appear paraphyletic with respect to Hawaiian
taros (i.e., they would branch off earlier from a single lineage leading
to all Hawaiian landraces). Since this is not the case, we hypothesize that early settlers brought several genetically and morphologically diverse landraces to Hawai‘i (at least representatives of Mana,
‘Ula‘ula, and Lauloa-Manini – though future studies including a
larger number of South Pacific accessions may turn up members of
additional groups as well). In this scenario, both Hawaiian and South
Pacific taro landraces are descendants of the same clades that were
already cultivated as humans first moved into Polynesia. Similar to
other canoe plants, these taro landraces may have been introduced
during a single pulse of settlement of Hawai‘i (Wilmshurst et al.
2011), or successively in multiple arrivals (Kirch 2014; Cho et al.
2007) until contact with the rest of East Polynesia ceased for several
centuries.
Two accessions that could not be assigned reliably to any clade,
‘Āweu and False Lihilihimōlina, also deserve further mention. Called
“wild taro” by Whitney et al. (1939), ‘Āweu was historically widespread in the mountains and forests of Hawai‘i. Despite undesirable characteristics such as high acridity and long rhizomes, it was
occasionally collected as food when other sources were scarce. The
so-called wild taros in Melanesia were hypothesized by Lebot and
Aradhya (1991) to be either clones from actual wild taros or ferals,
i.e., escapes from cultivation. Based on this SNP analysis, ‘Āweu
does appear to be genetically distinct from cultivated Hawaiian
taro, but it seems unlikely that actual wild taro was able to reach
Hawai‘i without human help. Instead, it might have escaped from
cultivation early during the settlement of Hawai‘i, and its closest
relatives were lost. On the other hand, False Lihilihimōlina in all
likelihood does not represent an older Hawaiian lineage. The original Hawaiian landrace Lihilihimōlina has been described as having
uniquely bi-colored corm flesh, lilac-purple at the center and surrounded by white (Whitney et al. 1939). However, the accessions
currently identified as Lihilihimōlina in Hawaiian taro collections
(including our sample) do not fit the description of this phenotype
(Frank Matsuno, personal communication). Genetically, the accession in our study also did not resemble any of the Hawaiian landraces and was instead found unaffiliated to any major group (Figure
1), or closer to the Asian accessions in our phylogenetic analyses
(Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Moreover, its allelic composition points to a hybrid origin, possibly involving Asian stock (Figure
3). Both anecdotal and experimental evidence thus suggest that the
original Lihilihimōlina has been lost and was replaced with a more
recent hybrid (hence our designation “false”).

Evidence for Somatic Mutation and Hybridization
In contrast to the pattern of clear differentiation between clades, we
found evidence for low genetic diversity within several clades. This
is especially apparent in the lack of phylogenetic resolution (Figure
1) and tight clustering by genetic similarity (Figure 2) seen in the
‘Ula‘ula, Lauloa-Manini, and Lehua clades. Since taro is typically
grown vegetatively from suckers (‘ohā) or petioles attached to the
meristem of the upper corm (huli), clades may often be composed

under strong genetic control, and were carefully maintained during
centuries of cultivation. Compared to other vegetatively propagated
crop plants like cassava (Elias et al. 2001; 2000), such broad agreement between genetic and morphological variation is unusual.
However, our phylogenetic analyses also revealed that most
Hawaiian taro groups contain more members than accounted for by
Whitney et al. (1939), often in the form of accessions previously left
unclassified because they failed to unambiguously display diagnostic
morphological traits. In addition to those within ‘Ula‘ula discussed
above, these accessions include several new members of the Mana
clade (e.g., Manapiko, which was considered neither a member of
Mana nor Piko, as well as Mana ‘Oko‘a and Makalau). Similarly,
the Lauloa-Manini clade contains several traditionally unaffiliated
Hawaiian accessions – Manini ‘Ōwali, Kūmū ‘Ele‘ele (both with
larger leaves), as well as Piko ‘Ele‘ele, Uahiapele, Nihopu‘u and
Manini ‘Ōpelu. The last 3 possess streaked or striped petioles, suggesting that this trait is concentrated in an extended group Manini,
which is well supported as a monophyletic group of its own (Figure
1). However, whether Lauloa forms a paraphyletic group with
respect to Manini (as shown in the primary maximum likelihood
tree, Figure 1), or is its sister group (as indicated by Figure 2 and
additional phylogenetic analyses, Supplementary Figures S1–S3)
remains ambiguous. We therefore suggest the provisional name
Lauloa–Manini for this clade.
The theme of clades including accessions beyond the members
of the morphology-based groups was especially pronounced in the
Lehua group: only a few landraces with purple corm color were
traditionally classified as Lehua (named after the red flower of
the ‘Ōhi‘a tree), but phylogenetic analysis showed that this clade
encompasses far more accessions, many of which display white to
cream-colored corm and were previously left unclassified. Loss of
corm color has been observed in hybrid cultivars with originally
purple corm flesh after tissue-culturing (personal observation),
indicating that this phenotype can revert by somatic mutation. The
revised Lehua group also contains several accessions that were traditionally assigned to other groups (e.g., Lauloa Ke‘oke‘o), indicating that the relation between phylogenetic kinship and the traits
described above is not always perfect. Indeed, the traditional groups
Piko and ‘Ele‘ele are not supported by genetic data as monophyletic, with most of their accessions joining the Lehua group (except
Piko Lehua Apei and Piko ‘Ele‘ele, which are found in the Mana
and Lauloa-Manini clades, respectively). In traditional Hawaiian
nomenclature, the Piko group is characterized by a leaf sinus cut
to the point of attachment to the petiole, or a dark-colored spot on
the upper surface of the leaf at the point of junction with the petiole
(Whitney et al. 1939). ‘Ele‘ele on the other hand is morphologically
defined by dark or black petioles (from Hawaiian ‘ele, meaning dark
or black). While the observation of a controlled cross suggests that
the Piko trait is genetically controlled (unpublished data), the Piko
and ‘Ele‘ele phenotypes seem to have originated several times independently. Assuming that mutations at multiple loci may be able to
produce these phenotypes, convergent evolution of (and subsequent
selection for) these traits could be more likely to occur. In further
support, primarily black or dark petioles are also found in accessions not formerly assigned to group ‘Ele‘ele, including accessions
in Lauloa-Manini and Lehua. Hybridization, which is discussed
further below, may be another mechanism leading to discrepancies
between morphological variation and phylogenetic relationships.
Weak correlation between morphology and genetic variation also
has been reported as widespread in similar crops like cassava (Elias
et al. 2001, 2000).

Conclusions
As a center of taro cultivation both presently and historically,
Hawai‘i possesses a wealth of morphologically diverse taro landraces that were bred or selected for different uses. Exploring this
diversity based on a genome-wide set of SNP markers, we made several discoveries concerning the phylogenetic relationships, cultivation history, and genetic basis of morphological traits in Hawaiian
taros. Phylogenetic analyses, patterns of genetic similarity, and population structure suggest that Polynesian settlers introduced several
genetically and morphologically distinct lineages of taro, which
then likely further diversified by selection of mutants, genetic drift
and occasional (possibly deliberate) hybridization. The underlying
genetic diversity, although relatively low compared to cultivation
centers closer to the geographic origin of taro, supports a considerable phenotypic diversity, which may have been carefully maintained
through clonal propagation over centuries of cultivation.
By largely confirming, and in some cases revising traditional
Hawaiian classification based on morphology, the SNP markers developed in this study hopefully will prove valuable for efforts to conserve
the diversity of Hawaiian taros. As demonstrated, they can be used to
reliably identify and discriminate among the majority of landraces,
many of which have already been lost to introduced pests and devastating pathogens such as taro leaf blight. Although conventional
breeding has been very successful to improve agronomically important
traits in taro, these markers also may facilitate investigations of the
genetic basis of relevant phenotypes including quality, taste, disease
resistance, or abiotic stress resistance, and the development of effective genetic fingerprinting methods to further study genetic diversity
and gene flow among taro landraces and cultivars outside of Hawai‘i.

of close genetic relatives derived from somatic mutations. Indeed,
according to Whitney et al. (1939) the Lauloa group is prone to
somatic mutations, and the landraces Lauloa Palakea ‘Ula and
Lauloa Palakea Papamū are considered to be somatic mutations that
originated from Lauloa Palakea ‘Ele‘ele. A possible mechanism for
this would be selection of desirable sports (phenotypically divergent
plant parts resulting from somatic mutation) by farmers rather than
crossing genotypes to create new cultivars. In the absence of specialized insect pollinators, such practice may have preserved the identity of clades over centuries. Accessions originating from somatic
mutants appear to be old enough to have accumulated additional
genetic changes. For instance, we detected 2–10 pairwise allelic differences between the 3 Lauloa landraces mentioned above. Other
closely related accessions are distinguished by a similar number of
differences, which is likely to be an underestimate due to the relatively high number of undetermined positions in these accessions.
However, it remains unclear whether selection of mutants and vegetative propagation became widespread because pollination by hand
was less efficient, or because of the ability to fix useful genotypes,
making them more uniform and stable.
Lack of phylogenetic resolution also may be caused by hybridization. In particular, hybridization between members of different
clades, occurring early in their evolutionary history, may obscure
inter-clade relationships despite subsequent diversification within
clades. Indeed, we detected compelling signatures of admixture in
several clades using STRUCTURE (Figure 3), and found additional
evidence in the TreeMix analyses (Supplementary Figure S6). While
the majority of Lehua and Lauloa-Manini (especially the putative
subgroup Lauloa) accessions were characterized by high membership coefficients for a single population cluster, accessions of other
clades could not be assigned unambiguously. This indicates that
Lehua and Lauloa-Manini are genetically more distinct (in line
with the PCA results, Figure 2), while all other clades—particularly
Mana, ‘Ula‘ula, and Kāī—have been subject to hybridization to
some degree. For example, ‘Ula‘ula and the Manini subgroup shared
a large fraction of alleles according to STRUCTURE (turquoise in
Figure 3), suggesting hybridization between members of these clades.
This scenario is supported by the inference of admixture events using
the TreeMix software (Supplementary Figure S6). Considering this
and similar patterns were found very consistently in all members, it
seems likely admixture occurred early in the evolutionary history of
these accessions, presumably before taro was introduced to Hawai‘i
by Polynesian settlers. Note that the 2 Asian taros also showed a
strong pattern of allelic diversity consistent with originating closer
to the likely geographic center of origin for taro. Interestingly, several accessions within the genetically more uniform clade Lehua possess membership coefficients also pointing to a mixed genetic origin.
Some of these have special roles in Hawaiian culture—for instance,
Pi‘i‘ali‘i or royal taro was used in religious ceremonies, whereas
Lauloa Ke‘oke‘o is known for its medical purposes (Whitney et
al. 1939, Cho et al. 2007). As these taros have both a signature of
admixture and very specific cultural uses, this might be an indication
that these accessions were purposefully bred, possibly by crossing, as
opposed to most other Hawaiian taros. In summary, the pattern of
low to moderate genetic differentiation within clades, higher levels
of differentiation between clades, and lack of phylogenetic resolution between clades was likely shaped by a combination of early
hybridization and frequent propagation of somatic mutants. Such
patterns of diversification by multiple processes have been observed
in other cultivated plants with mixed modes of reproduction (sexual
versus clonal) such as sweet potatoes (Roullier et al. 2013).
